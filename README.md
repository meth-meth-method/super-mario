# Code Super Mario Bros. in JavaScript

Create a Super Mario game in vanilla JavaScript from scratch. 

This project is built during my YouTube series [Code Super Mario in JS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS8HfBXv9ZWWe8zXrViYbIM2Hhylx8DZx); a series by my channel [Meth Meth Method](https://www.youtube.com/MethMethMethod).

## Contributing

Please contribute if you see something wrong, but I can unforunately not merge your PR directly into 
`master` as I use Git commits as a script for creating the tutorial and commits out of sequence would throw me off.
